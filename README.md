Rust Programming - A Brief Overview

Rust is a modern systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It provides memory safety without a garbage collector, making it ideal for performance-critical applications. Rust's key features include:

Memory Safety: Prevents common bugs like null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows.

Concurrency: Ensures thread safety with its ownership model.

Performance: Comparable to C/C++ with zero-cost abstractions.

Tooling: Built-in package manager (Cargo) and excellent documentation.

Rust is widely used for systems programming, web assembly, and building reliable, efficient software. Its growing community and ecosystem make it a great choice for open-source projects.
